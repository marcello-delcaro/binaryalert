BinaryAlert is an open-source serverless AWS pipeline where any file uploaded to an S3 bucket is
immediately scanned with a configurable set of `YARA <https://virustotal.github.io/yara/>`_ rules.
An alert will fire as soon as any match is found, giving an incident response team the ability to
quickly contain the threat before it spreads.

Read the documentation at `binaryalert.io <https://binaryalert.io>`_.

****************
THOR integration
****************

This repository fork utilizes THOR Thunderstorm (THOR as a web service, see `https://www.nextron-systems.com/thor-thunderstorm/`) to replace  yextend and yara-python to check for YARA matches.

  :alt: THOR Integration with BinaryAlert

This integration has the following advantages:

* Includes THOR's 15,000+ hand-crafted YARA rule set with focus on 
   * APT related malware 
   * Hack tools 
   * Forensic artefacts 
   * Obfuscation techniques 
   * Web shells
* Special file type support
   * Registry hives (full walk and IOC application)
   * Memory dumps (full YARA scan)
   * EVTX Eventlogs (log parsing and IOC application)
   * WER files (error report analysis)

You can still use your custom YARA rules along with the THOR encrypted rule set by placing them in the ``./custom-signatures/yara`` sub folder in THOR's program folder.

We've replaced the original YARA scanning method and reduced the YARA scanning to a sinlge instance. It takes much longer to apply two rule sets one after another than combining them first and applying them in a single step. 

************
Requirements
************

This BinaryAlert fork requires 

* a THOR "service" license and 
* a THOR package for Linux (minimum version 10.6.0)

***************
Getting Started
***************

1. Get a THOR 10 for Linux package
2. Get a THOR service license from the Nextron customer portal
3. Extract the THOR 10 for Linux package and place the license in the extracted program directory
4. Clone this binaryalert fork ``git clone https://github.com/NextronSystems/binaryalert.git``
5. ``cd`` into the ``thor10-linux`` directory
6. Add the THOR 10 program folder with the ``*.lic`` license file to ``dependencies.zip`` in the binaryalert folder ``zip -ur ../binaryalert/lambda_functions/analyzer/dependencies.zip ./``

Place the contents from the THOR package and your THOR license into ``lambda_functions/analyzer/dependencies.zip``.

============================
Add Your Customer YARA Rules
============================

Place your rules in the folder - or better: a dedicated sub folder - within ``./rules``. Your rules will automatically get initialized with THOR. 

==========================
Activate Advanced Features
==========================

To activate the advanced analyzers for the file types mentioned above (registry hives, memory dumps, EVTX files, WER files), removed the ``--pure-yara`` flag in the file ``yara_analyzer.py``.
